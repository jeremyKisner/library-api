# Library App
Just a playground to practice front and back end skills.


## Library API
Change directories into the API source code
``` bash
    cd .\library-api\
```

### Install requirements
``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the API server:
``` bash
    python3 .\main\app.py
```

To run tests for the API:
``` bash
    python3 -m pytest .\tests\
```


## Library UI
### TODO
1. Add a cart for checking out books

Now, change directory into the library-ui:
``` bash
cd library-ui
```

Then, start the UI:
``` bash
npm start
```
